# efellows-tag-blocker
Note: Current version only blocks the tag "jura". You can adjust this on your own in the file _contentscript.js_ and adding the tags you wish to block to the array _blocklist_. Contributions to improve this are welcome! 

An official chrome extension can be found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/e-fellows-tag-blocker/phpledkfijaogamgelgikggoafdmjajo?hl=en-GB&authuser=0).
